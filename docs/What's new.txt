What's new in PSLEGENDARY EDITION
==================================
What is PSLEGENDARY EDITION?

It's called Project Shadow Legendary Edition, it's a project that started in the middle of 2016, it was one of the first 
projects I've started to develop using the source code of version 0.175 [HBMAME], at that time I called it PSMame Builds Plus, now I am focusing on updating the rest of the hack roms that could not be included in the HBMAME version in the 2020 year.

It is being used as the base system of the project PSMame Plus Metal Slug Forever Special Edition version 0.215 [HBMAME].

I am only giving support for the Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems, 
for the 86/64 bit cpu of the compatible microprocessors.
